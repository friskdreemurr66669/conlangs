cvc, cvcc, ccvc, vc, cv, v

you need a y between an i and any other vowel (eg: ia to iya)
you need an i between a y and any other consonant (eg: dya to diya)
there can be no iy without a vowel after it
if there is an i at the end of a word, it's changed to a y (klavi -> klavy)
when a word ends with y and there's a suffix, it's changed to either i or removed

phonetic spelling

fricatives cannot follow plosives

no double letters
the only consecutive vowels are diphthongs (they can follow y even if it's used as a vowel)

words cannot end with plosives, h, r

if affix leads to a consecutive vowel, only use the first vowel (shouldn't be used if the word/the affix is setup properly)
if affix leads to a duplicate consonant, only use 1 consonant (shouldn't be used if the word/the affix is setup properly)

words can be just a consonant
