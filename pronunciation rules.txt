if y is used after a vowel (excluding i) or ending a word, it's pronounced /i/.

when there's a iy, the i isn't pronounced if it's unstressed

unstressed a is pronounced ɑ (open back, not central unstressed open a)
unstressed e is pronounced ɜ
unstressed o is pronounced ə
unstressed i is pronounced ɪ
unstressed u is pronounced ɤ

if the last letter of a word is an unstressed vowel (and isn't a diphthong), it can be pronounced ə

when a word is just a consonant, it is either pronounced as an affix (by default a suffix)
if the single consonant word doesn't as a suffix or prefix (both sides are already blocked by other consonants), use it as a single word with a ə after

there is a small pause after punctuation
